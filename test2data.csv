"Just a reminder who the reigning champions are!
#WeTheNorth"
Nice win by the Toronto Raptors last night #WeTheNorth
Me scrolling through endless Raptors love on my timeline this morning 
The only State that didn’t cheer for the Raptors in last years finals is now called Kyleofornia
That’s right god dammit! There’s no “I” in team. (BTW that’s an “i” and not a lowercase “L”)
10 passes. Unselfish hoops. The Raptors ball movement is a thing of beauty.
"Heading to Toronto, you already know Imma buy #Raptors merch "
They was going to lose that game anyway.
Our champs are back!
The understatement of the century!
ADOBE? Who the heck is dat Mr. Worthy? I mean BIG GAME JAMES was one of my favourite players ever...but man oh man did he bungle the names in this segment! 
"This is the face of a man who misses playing with Kyle, Pascal, Marc, Fred and Serge."
That fan in the background says everything about Raptor fans
"No doubts, no questions PERIOD"
Who needs the KLAW when you have KLOE?
Ayyyy shoutout North Dakota
We got your back next win dw 
I'm surprised Trump hasn't sent out an angry tweet about Lebron singing O Canada last night
"I was turning up a little bit last so I missed a good portion of the game lol, BUT it was on and I could feel the vibes. "
It's not how you start but how you finish but oh what a sweet start it was! 
"bit more than that, shannon. we’ll see the excuses y’all make on monday morning"
Might as well just flood the replies with this
OG making my prediction look pretty good early!
"This guy has no idea Toronto's love of blue collar players that have a ""hockey"" mentality. The way Kyle plays, his overall personality has won over an entire country."
"As a raptors fan, I am always bothered by the lack of shine our team gets. "
Only one man named Kyle showed up to the game last night
Ellite club 
Kyle Lowry almost outscoring LeBron James and Anthony Davis ... who saw that coming?
Great return to basketball by the defending champions. These two teams really are the best defensively and we saw that all night. Great performance by the heart and soul of the Raptors Kyle Lowry
We know and are quietly confident. 
The Raps are going back to back
"seem to forget when Klay went down in Game 6, Raptors were trailing by less than 10."
It’s ridiculous how the American sports media is talking about how disappointed they are in the Lakers
this bears repeating #Raptors
Isn't it such a funny thing that everyone that loses to the Ratptos is because they had cold shooters that night lol
"At this point it’s safe to say that Kawhi lost Toronto. Had a great team, no drama and a very high chance of going back to back. Hope he’s happy with Lil Lemon Pepper Lou."
Nothing but Raptor Porn on the TL last night
OG's massive back to back 3s to negate LeBrons were massive to that win
Kyle Lowry the real MVP
"Understand him or no, Kyle is the greatest raptor of all time. Pay close attention because I see"
Still forgetting who stupidly tried to call timeout when his team had none left ?
I am starting to push the panic button on the Lakers they don't look good at 
"Kyle actually has the whole country that says ""Kyle Lowry is my favorite NBA player""."
Who’s the greatest number 43 in Toronto sports?
So the Raptors looked great against the Lakers as they picked up the W. Their Championship pedigree on display
Good call - he’ll look good in red!!
You hate to see it.
The king has spoken Great take on how he views the raptors
i would have to agree !
"The irony. It’s OG ANUNOBY, not Adobe "
Great take on how he views the
Raptors get 11th straight win all time verse the Lakers since 2014 
Nurse: Champion Raptors haven't reached ceiling
HOW ABOUT THEM #RAPTORS!!! K-Low Leads The Team: 33 Pts and 14 boards!!
Sounds like he might want to buy some Canadian real estate
You could at least pretend to follow basketball George! And yet you chose to be ignorant instead. 
Just putting it out there now - NBA Finals 2020 will be the 
Take Note Rest Of League.. We Serious.
"Nick Nurse is obviously one of the best coaches in the NBA - he's bright, creative, & innovative. "
"Bros! Haha Great win, way to grind that one out lastnight!!"
I tried to sleep it off but I CANNOT. 
eams had a captain this is the dude right here for the
A whole next level yet to come. Love the game. Appreciate the skills. Cheer the champs. Let’s go Raptors!
Lowry was the best player on the court last night.
We're sweeping the Lakers in the finals. You heard it here first folks. I'm reviving this post when it happens. 
Makes you wonder if there was intent behind the term 
"Nice to see you refer the Raps as the “Champions” after your rants about Warriors would have, dissing Canada, blah, blah, blah..."
"Volunteerism sounds more like Liberal political activism masquerading as volunteering, while (ab)using taxpayer funding to achieve it."
Underestimated us last year & again this year
"Kyle - ""Good game refs"" Refs - "
The Raptors are Champions and arguably the most well-run organization in the league
We as fans need to stop acting as if this team has anything left to prove 
Kawhi realizing he should of stayed with the
We did not win the championship by charity..but because we know and play ball. Before the COVID-19 did we beat a superhero team and Giannis? 
"Covid-19, polar vortex, hurricanes; bring it"
"I mean, who doesn’t love OG Adobe? Amazing basketball player and heir apparent to the global software company too"
Yup. Bandwagon. I've been a fan since 2003. Those 20-30 win seasons. I've been watching balls since Dr J and George Gervin. I know a damned good team when I see it 
"There's a few million of us George. In a country north of yours. Furthermore, Kyle Lowry is going to the HOF&he's getting a big fat statue outside of SBA. You laugh?"
what y’all think the Raptors are vs what the Raptors really are
